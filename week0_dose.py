
# week 0 problem 1
# create a function that returns a list of (vitamins,injections) tuples for each attribute that they need.
# Complete problem statement in README.mds


# your input type should be a list,
# output should also be a list containing tuples
# Example:
# input: [250, 0, 250, 0, 0, 0]
# expected output: [(25,0),(0,0),(25,0),(0,0),(0,0),(0,0)]
# input: [500, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#expected output: "No medicine given"
# HINT: using % operator to find remainder may be helpful
def dose(needs):
    #YOUR SOLUTION STARTS HERE
    if sum(needs) > 500 or max(needs)> 250:
        return "No medicine given"
    else:
        return [(x/10, 0) if x%10 == 0 else (int(x/10)+1, 10 - x%10) for x in needs]
